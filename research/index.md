### Research Philosophy

As an organization, we maintain a portfolio of research projects driven by fundamental research, new product innovation, product contribution and infrastructure goals, while providing individuals and teams the freedom to emphasize specific types of work. We strive to create an environment conducive to many different types of research across many different time scales and levels of risk.

We believe successful industry research requires managing a portfolio of projects with time horizons, levels of risk and goals appropriate for the organization. Our approach to research has always been flexible. Machine learning (ML) is a transformative technology that touches everything we do as a company.
