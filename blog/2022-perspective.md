## Data Analytics Outlook for 2022

### No-code for data

Low- and no-code platforms allow developers and non-developers alike to create software through visual dashboards instead of traditional programming. Adoption is on the rise, with a recent OutSystems report showing that 41% of organizations were using a low- or no-code tool in 2020, up from 34% in 2019.


### Citizen science will be an influential, related 2022 trend

In an effort to democratize data science, cloud providers will be developing and releasing more machine learning applications and other building block tools such as domain-specific machine learning workflows. This is a seminal trend, because, over time, the level of what individuals will need to code is going to decrease. This will open up machine learning to many more job roles: some of these citizen scientists will be within central IT, and some will live within lines of business.

### Right Data VS Big Data

‘Right data’ analytics will surpass Big Data analytics as a key 2022 trend
Big Data is almost too big and is creating data swamps that are hard to leverage. Precisely finding the right data in place no matter where it was created and ingesting it for data analytics is a game-changer because it will save ample time and manual effort while delivering more relevant analysis. So, instead of Big Data, a new trend will be the development of so-called “right data” analytic


### Data analytics ‘in place’ will dominate


### Multicloud will evolve with different data strategies
