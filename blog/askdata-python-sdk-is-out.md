<p>We are excited to announce the public beta of the Askdata Python SDK, the first version of our Python community-driven open source projects.

It has been tested against 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6.</li><li>The API interfaces are consistent and guessable</li><li>Handles agent messaging and insights creation</li></ol><h4><strong>Test drive now</strong></h4><p>You can test-driven the SDK using this ready-to-go Colab: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/AskdataInc/askdata-examples/blob/master/notebooks/Askdata%20-%20Quickstart.ipynb">Askdata Colab Notebook Quickstart</a></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal"><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/AskdataInc/askdata-examples/blob/master/notebooks/Askdata%20-%20Quickstart.ipynb" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dff758010bfa7356f98e395/5ec7c228ad11d9d560e6e76c_colab.svg"></div></a></figure><p>More examples can be found inside the <a href="https://github.com/AskdataHQ/askdata-examples">Askdata Examples Repository</a>.</p><h4>Why releasing an&nbsp;SDK&nbsp;now</h4><p>We are rewriting all the SDKs from scratch, we wanted to give a common version to all of them this time.
