## Data Analytics Outlook for 2022

<img src="/media/blog/data-analytics-2022-outlook/cover.png" alt="Data Analytics Outlook for 2022" class="image-doc" />

At Askdata We foresee five technological trends, which will shape the data analytics market for this 2022.

### No-code for data

Low- and no-code platforms allow developers and non-developers alike to create software through visual dashboards instead of traditional programming. Adoption is on the rise, with a recent OutSystems report showing that 41% of organizations were using a low- or no-code tool in 2020, up from 34% in 2019.


### Citizen science will be an influential, related 2022 trend

In an effort to democratize data science, tech providers will be developing and releasing more machine learning applications and other building block tools such as domain-specific machine learning workflows. This is a seminal trend, because, over time, the level of what individuals will need to code is going to decrease. This will open up machine learning to many more job roles: some of these citizen scientists will be within central IT, and some will live within lines of business.

### Right Data VS Big Data

‘Right data’ analytics will surpass Big Data analytics as a key 2022 trend. As analytics platforms support more data sources, organizations will have to prioritize what data to use for particular analyses. Precisely finding the right data in place no matter where it was created and ensuring that it meets the intended use case will continue to be the most important challenge for the enterprise. So, instead of Big Data, a new trend will be the development of so-called “right data” analytics.


### Multicloud will evolve with different data strategies

As organizations become more comfortable with the idea of multiple cloud providers, they will begin to recognize that the cloud strategy can be varied by use case or by data type. In fact, in 2022, we will see organizations choose a different cloud provider for each use case or data type.


### Data Analytics applications based on neural networks

Neural networks will be the "smart engine" behind data applications. Neural networks are a class of machine learning models that are inspired by the structure of the brain. These models learn from data and construct a model by connecting the units in the network in such a way that similar patterns are processed by the same units. Most modern AI applications rely on neural networks.

Our team believes that this last trend is the most important transformational trend for data analytics and business intelligence. That's why we are committing to building the firm neural network-driven platform that is able to reduce to zero the effort required to access and analyze data.
