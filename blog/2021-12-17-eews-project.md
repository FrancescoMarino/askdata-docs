## Earthquake Early Warning Systems

Full title: Earthquake Early Warning Systems

Duration: 24 months

Research Organization: University of Rome "Tor Vergata"

Companies: INNAAS srl (Askdata), Via Panama, 52, 00198 Rome, Italy

Project objectives:

This proposal refers to the "Aerospace" AdS.

The project idea arises from the evidence that there is normally a very limited time between the rupture of the nucleation that causes an earthquake and the release of its devastating effects on the population and on the buildings.

Such timing makes it very difficult to implement effective warning systems for the institutions responsible for safeguarding the territory and the inhabitants of the geographical area at risk of seismic.

The last two decades have been characterized by enormous technological advances for a more rapid, complete and effective detection of signals and measurements of parameters relevant for the probabilistic prediction of an earthquake and its consequences, through the development of increasingly sophisticated sensors, as well as satellite systems capable of carrying out broad-spectrum monitoring over the entire earth's surface and increasingly high-performance data transmission networks, last but not least the 5G infrastructure

Nonetheless, it is necessary to implement intelligent systems and rapid decision and communication mechanisms (without human interaction) to create an effective early warning tool that generates alert messages to the population and induces, especially by the authorities in charge, suitable actions. to reduce the risk of damage to people and property.

The Earthquake Early Warning Systems (EEWS) project to be implemented brings together concepts, methods and technologies of Real-Time (RT) seismology to achieve this goal. The combination of all these factors will allow the development of new theories and practices on Earthquake nucleation process thus creating the basis for the evolution of EEWS towards future systems.
