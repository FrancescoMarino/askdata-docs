<p>Askdata is a platform that leverages a combination of Naturla Language Processing&nbsp;(NLP) Natural Language Generation (NLG) to transform data into clear, human-sounding narratives helping the user become more self-sufficient in dashboard interpretation.</p><p><strong>What is Askdata</strong></p><p>Askdata augmented analytics platform allows users to rapidly find the proverbial needle in a haystack. NLP and underlying knowledge graphs are being extended to analyze unstructured and other data types.</p><p>NLP and conversational analytics brings ease of use to a new level, and allows a query to be as easy as a Google-like search or a conversation digital assistants, such as Alexa. The combination of NLP with augmented analytics — including automatic insight generation — allows users to rapidly presenting the most-important and actionable insights via search-driven interface with natural language generation. </p><p>We deploy robust NLP interfaces include industry or domain-specific taxonomies and linguistics (such as HR, finance, healthcare or financial services) so that phrases are more correctly interpreted. NLP and conversational interfaces are being embedded in analytics and BI platforms, digital personal assistants, chatbots and applications. NLP provides intuitive forms of communication between humans and systems. </p><p>NLP and underlying knowledge graphs are being extended to analyze unstructured and other data types, and used as a foundation for data science as well as ML/AI models. </p><p><strong>How Does This Impact Your Organization and Skills?</strong></p><p>Conversational analytics can dramatically improve the adoption of analytics by every employee, rather than by predominant power users and business analysts, resulting in higher business impact. However, as access to more powerful insights permeates the organization at all skill levels, there is a need for a formal and enterprise wide focus on improving the data literacy of all users.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p>
