#### Askdata makes Supply Chain management more effective by simplifying your interaction with data. 

By interacting with the Askdata platform it is possible to have a clear overview regarding the performance and quality of suppliers.

Quickly search across logistics, warehouse management and other SC systems to get the answer right away.

For example, it will be possible to request in natural language data relating to the main supplier in terms of annual costs for a specific geographic area, and always for the same supplier to view the cost trends of the last 5 years.
