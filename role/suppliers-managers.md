## For Suppliers Managers

#### The outsourcing of activities is an important strategic lever, however it is necessary to implement effective supplier governance

By interacting with the Askdata platform it is possible to have a clear overview regarding the performance and quality of suppliers.
For example, it will be possible to request in natural language data relating to the main supplier in terms of annual costs for a specific geographic area, and always for the same supplier to view the cost trends of the last 5 years.
Furthermore, by integrating with external databases (open data logic), Askdata allows access to insights relating to specific areas of interest, such as the compliance of suppliers in relation to sustainability (ESG Environmental, Social and Governance) and ethical criteria.
