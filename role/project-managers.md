## For Project Managers

<h5>Eefficient project monitoring and management is not always possible, given the complexity of the tools currently available.</h5>

Askdata, through artificial intelligence algorithms, simplifies the interaction between people and data. In the world of project management, the availability of up-to-date and easily readable data is essential.

The platform enables users to request, for example: the status of expiring activities, planning delays, the load of the various teams involved, estimates and forecasts relating to timing and costs in a desired time range.

Askdata supports numerous languages, so it is possible to interact with the platform in different geographical areas without losing the quality of the insights.
